This program aims to create a decision tree model that predicts the income level of individuals. The model is trained using a training dataset and tested using a separate test dataset to determine its accuracy. The model uses specific parameters to predict the income level of an individual, and the program reports the accuracy of this prediction.

To complete this project, you will need to import the following packages: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, LabelEncoder, DecisionTreeClassifier, StringIO, Image, Graphviz, Export_graphviz, Pydotplus, Metrics, Accuracy_score, Classification_report, Confusion_matrix, F1_score, Precision_score, Recall_score, Roc_auc_score, and Roc_curve.
